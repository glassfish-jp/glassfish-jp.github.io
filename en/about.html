			<h2>History</h2>
			<h3>Establishment</h3>
			<p>This group is established in 2006 by techonology evangelists of Sun Microsystems Japan. The first president was Takayuki Okazaki, and Yoshio Terada joined as a board member.</p>
			<p>At first, the group was led by a vendor (Sun Microsystems). The main mission of the group was introduction to GlassFish (reference implementation of Java EE) for users and developers in Japan.</p>
			<h3>With Sun Microsystems</h3>
			<p>We acted in "Hot Topic Seminor" by Sun Microsystems and several conferences. Some core members also acted as contributors for GlassFish I18N project.</p>
			<h3>With Oracle Japan</h3>
			<p>Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle and the Japanese company became a part of Oracle Japan on June 2010. The group restarted with support of Oracle Japan. Kenji Hasunuma joined as the vice-president and acted over many works of the president. After that, the group had acted to introduce Java EE and GlassFish in Japan until September 2015.</p>
			<h3>Become a vendor dependent JUG</h3>
			<p>The group was independent from support of Oracle Japan on September 2015. Takayuki Okazaki (president) and Kenji Hasunuma (vice-president) resigned at the time, and several staffs have been leading the group. Currently, the group is building system that all the member can each members act their own role.</p>
